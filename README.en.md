## Tweets card

This is a project that displays tweet cards with the user's image, the number of
tweets and the number of followers - this number is interactive, since its value
changes depending on the click of the "follow" button (which, when clicked,
changes the text to "following" and changes the background color).

The "Load More" button loads the next number of cards (namely: 3)
